Project Zomboid chainsaw item mod

I want to chop down trees with a chainsaw. My main priority is to get
the functionality. I plan to consider sound and graphics after I can cut
down trees and perhaps carve logs into planks.

Ideas:
- chop logs on the ground into planks on the ground
- chainsaw will require gas
- chainsaw will be fairly loud, but not quite gunshot loud
- chainsaw will be a handy zombie weapon
